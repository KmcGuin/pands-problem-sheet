# I didn't use external sources for this - I tried to rework the lab from Week 05 to apply to this, as described in the file.

# es.py Week 07
# I created a file called ulysses.txt, which includes an excerpt from James Joyce's Ulysses. I opened the file as a read document in python, following instructions from the lecture. I defined a function that counted the number of a particular letter, this can be changed depending on your letter of choice. I defined the 'lettercount' - ans = lettercount to allow me to add text and use the function method to return the answer to the number of times the letter 'e' appears in the execpt. 
# I used the sys module - sys.argv - to try to add the anme of the text to the python file from the command line. sys.argv is a simple list structure. Itâ€™s main purposes are:
# - It is a list of command line arguments.
# - len(sys.argv) provides the number of command line arguments.
# - sys.argv[0] is the name of the current Python script.

# Week 08 - weekly task Plotting
# I found this useful to talk through the task simply: https://www.sharpsightlabs.com/blog/numpy-random-normal/
# I also watched this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufO_BScIHDQ
# Other references I looked at: 
# https://rowannicholls.github.io/python/graphs/ax_based/histograms.html
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-plot-a-dashed-line-in-matplotlib/
# https://realpython.com/python-histograms/
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-plot-normal-distribution-over-histogram-in-python/
# To begin with, I imported numpy and matplotlib to work with plotting graphs.I had tried the scipy library as well after doing some reading but I don't think this was needed in the end so I removed it. 
# I defined the data set - normal_data - indicating a loc(mean) of 5, scale(stdev) of 2 and size of 1000. I can across those definitions (loc and scale) in my reading on the topic. I tried running the program without loc and scale, using just numbers i.e 5,2,1000 - and it also worked.
# I defined the xpoints and ypoints as demonstrated in the lecture on the topic. I noticed when I ran the array with range of 0-10, the plotted line only reached 9 on the graph. I heard in the youtube video referenced above that it often discounts the last point on the range so I changed the array to 0-11 to make sure the plotted line reached 10.
# I plotted the line, giving it a blue colour and dashed looked to make it stand out more, alongside the relevant label and legend.
# I labelled the x and y axes of the histogram and gave it a title, as was demonstrated in the lecture. 
# I gave the histogram some characteristics, such as a white colour and a black edge so that it worked nicely alongside the blue plotted line. I came across the coloredge function in my reading and thought it was a good way to define the lines. And I like the white background when running a colour through it. It looks cleaner visually than plotting a blue line through another colour for example.
# I saved off the graph as a .png as well, just for the fun.
