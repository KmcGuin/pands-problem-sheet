# es.py Week 07
# I created a file called ulysses.txt, which includes an excerpt from James Joyce's Ulysses. I opened the file as a read document in python, following instructions from the lecture. I defined a function that counted the number of a particular letter, this can be changed depending on your letter of choice. I defined the 'lettercount' - ans = lettercount to allow me to add text and use the function method to return the answer to the number of times the letter 'e' appears in the execpt. 
# I used the sys module - sys.argv - to try to add the anme of the text to the python file from the command line. sys.argv is a simple list structure. Itâ€™s main purposes are:
# - It is a list of command line arguments.
# - len(sys.argv) provides the number of command line arguments.
# - sys.argv[0] is the name of the current Python script.
