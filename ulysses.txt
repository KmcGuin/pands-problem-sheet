\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec3 Get a light snack in Davy Byrne\'92s. Stopgap. Keep me going. Had a good breakfast.\
\'97Roast and mashed here.\
\'97Pint of stout.\
Every fellow for his own, tooth and nail. Gulp. Grub. Gulp. Gobstuff.\
He came out into clearer air and turned back towards Grafton street. Eat or be eaten. Kill! Kill!\
Suppose that communal kitchen years to come perhaps. All trotting down with porringers and tommycans to be filled. Devour contents in the street. John Howard Parnell example the provost of Trinity every mother\'92s son don\'92t talk of your provosts and provost of Trinity women and children cabmen priests parsons fieldmarshals archbishops. From Ailesbury road, Clyde road, artisans\'92 dwellings, north Dublin union, lord mayor in his gingerbread coach, old queen in a bathchair. My plate\'92s empty. After you with our incorporated drinkingcup. Like sir Philip Crampton\'92s fountain. Rub off the microbes with your handkerchief. Next chap rubs on a new batch with his. Father O\'92Flynn would make hares of them all. Have rows all the same. All for number one. Children fighting for the scrapings of the pot. Want a souppot as big as the Phoenix park. Harpooning flitches and hindquarters out of it. Hate people all round you. City Arms hotel\'a0
\f1\i table d\'92h\'f4te
\f0\i0 \'a0she called it. Soup, joint and sweet. Never know whose thoughts you\'92re chewing. Then who\'92d wash up all the plates and forks? Might be all feeding on tabloids that time. Teeth getting worse and worse.\
After all there\'92s a lot in that vegetarian fine flavour of things from the earth garlic of course it stinks after Italian organgrinders crisp of onions mushrooms truffles. Pain to the animal too. Pluck and draw fowl. Wretched brutes there at the cattlemarket waiting for the poleaxe to split their skulls open. Moo. Poor trembling calves. Meh. Staggering bob. Bubble and squeak. Butchers\'92 buckets wobbly lights. Give us that brisket off the hook. Plup. Rawhead and bloody bones. Flayed glasseyed sheep hung from their haunches, sheepsnouts bloodypapered snivelling nosejam on sawdust. Top and lashers going out. Don\'92t maul them pieces, young one.\
Hot fresh blood they prescribe for decline. Blood always needed. Insidious. Lick it up smokinghot, thick sugary. Famished ghosts.\
Ah, I\'92m hungry.\
He entered Davy Byrne\'92s. Moral pub. He doesn\'92t chat. Stands a drink now and then. But in leapyear once in four. Cashed a cheque for me once.\
What will I take now? He drew his watch. Let me see now. Shandygaff?\
\'97Hello, Bloom, Nosey Flynn said from his nook.\
\'97Hello, Flynn.\
\'97How\'92s things?\
\'97Tiptop\'85 Let me see. I\'92ll take a glass of burgundy and\'85 let me see.\
Sardines on the shelves. Almost taste them by looking. Sandwich? Ham and his descendants musterred and bred there. Potted meats. What is home without Plumtree\'92s potted meat? Incomplete. What a stupid ad! Under the obituary notices they stuck it. All up a plumtree. Dignam\'92s potted meat. Cannibals would with lemon and rice. White missionary too salty. Like pickled pork. Expect the chief consumes the parts of honour. Ought to be tough from exercise. His wives in a row to watch the effect.\'a0
\f1\i There was a right royal old nigger. Who ate or something the somethings of the reverend Mr MacTrigger
\f0\i0 . With it an abode of bliss. Lord knows what concoction. Cauls mouldy tripes windpipes faked and minced up. Puzzle find the meat. Kosher. No meat and milk together. Hygiene that was what they call now. Yom Kippur fast spring cleaning of inside. Peace and war depend on some fellow\'92s digestion. Religions. Christmas turkeys and geese. Slaughter of innocents. Eat drink and be merry. Then casual wards full after. Heads bandaged. Cheese digests all but itself. Mity cheese.\
\'97Have you a cheese sandwich?\
\'97Yes, sir.\
Like a few olives too if they had them. Italian I prefer. Good glass of burgundy take away that. Lubricate. A nice salad, cool as a cucumber, Tom Kernan can dress. Puts gusto into it. Pure olive oil. Milly served me that cutlet with a sprig of parsley. Take one Spanish onion. God made food, the devil the cooks. Devilled crab.\
\'97Wife well?\
\'97Quite well, thanks\'85 A cheese sandwich, then. Gorgonzola, have you?\
\'97Yes, sir.\
Nosey Flynn sipped his grog.\
\'97Doing any singing those times?\
Look at his mouth. Could whistle in his own ear. Flap ears to match. Music. Knows as much about it as my coachman. Still better tell him. Does no harm. Free ad.\
\'97She\'92s engaged for a big tour end of this month. You may have heard perhaps.\
\'97No. O, that\'92s the style. Who\'92s getting it up?\
The curate served.\
\'97How much is that?\
\'97Seven d., sir\'85 Thank you, sir.\
Mr Bloom cut his sandwich into slender strips.\'a0
\f1\i Mr MacTrigger
\f0\i0 . Easier than the dreamy creamy stuff.\'a0
\f1\i His five hundred wives. Had the time of their lives.\cb1 \uc0\u8232 
\f0\i0 \uc0\u8232 \cb2 \'97Mustard, sir?\
\'97Thank you.\
He studded under each lifted strip yellow blobs.\'a0
\f1\i Their lives
\f0\i0 . I have it.\'a0
\f1\i It grew bigger and bigger and bigger
\f0\i0 .\
\'97Getting it up? he said. Well, it\'92s like a company idea, you see. Part shares and part profits.\
\'97Ay, now I remember, Nosey Flynn said, putting his hand in his pocket to scratch his groin. Who is this was telling me? Isn\'92t Blazes Boylan mixed up in it?\
A warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on Mr Bloom\'92s heart. He raised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock. Two. Pub clock five minutes fast. Time going on. Hands moving. Two. Not yet.\
His midriff yearned then upward, sank within him, yearned more longly, longingly.\
Wine.\
He smellsipped the cordial juice and, bidding his throat strongly to speed it, set his wineglass delicately down.\
\'97Yes, he said. He\'92s the organiser in point of fact.\
No fear: no brains.\
Nosey Flynn snuffled and scratched. Flea having a good square meal.\
\'97He had a good slice of luck, Jack Mooney was telling me, over that boxingmatch Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the Portobello barracks. By God, he had the little kipper down in the county Carlow he was telling me\'85\
Hope that dewdrop doesn\'92t come down into his glass. No, snuffled it up.\
\'97For near a month, man, before it came off. Sucking duck eggs by God till further orders. Keep him off the boose, see? O, by God, Blazes is a hairy chap.\
Davy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in tuckstitched shirtsleeves, cleaning his lips with two wipes of his napkin. Herring\'92s blush. Whose smile upon each feature plays with such and such replete. Too much fat on the parsnips.\
\'97And here\'92s himself and pepper on him, Nosey Flynn said. Can you give us a good one for the Gold cup?\
\'97I\'92m off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered. I never put anything on a horse.\
\'97You\'92re right there, Nosey Flynn said.\
Mr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish of disgust pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese. Sips of his wine soothed his palate. Not logwood that. Tastes fuller this weather with the chill off.\
Nice quiet bar. Nice piece of wood in that counter. Nicely planed. Like the way it curves there.\
\'97I wouldn\'92t do anything at all in that line, Davy Byrne said. It ruined many a man, the same horses.\
Vintners\'92 sweepstake. Licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises. Heads I win tails you lose.\
\'97True for you, Nosey Flynn said. Unless you\'92re in the know. There\'92s no straight sport going now. Lenehan gets some good ones. He\'92s giving Sceptre today. Zinfandel\'92s the favourite, lord Howard de Walden\'92s, won at Epsom. Morny Cannon is riding him. I could have got seven to one against Saint Amant a fortnight before.\
\'97That so? Davy Byrne said\'85\
He went towards the window and, taking up the pettycash book, scanned its pages.\
\'97I could, faith, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. That was a rare bit of horseflesh. Saint Frusquin was her sire. She won in a thunderstorm, Rothschild\'92s filly, with wadding in her ears. Blue jacket and yellow cap. Bad luck to big Ben Dollard and his John O\'92Gaunt. He put me off it. Ay.\
He drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the flutes.\
\'97Ay, he said, sighing.\
Mr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh. Nosey numbskull. Will I tell him that horse Lenehan? He knows already. Better let him forget. Go and lose more. Fool and his money. Dewdrop coming down again. Cold nose he\'92d have kissing a woman. Still they might like. Prickly beards they like. Dogs\'92 cold noses. Old Mrs Riordan with the rumbling stomach\'92s Skye terrier in the City Arms hotel. Molly fondling him in her lap. O, the big doggybowwowsywowsy!\
Wine soaked and softened rolled pith of bread mustard a moment mawkish cheese. Nice wine it is. Taste it better because I\'92m not thirsty. Bath of course does that. Just a bite or two. Then about six o\'92clock I can. Six. Six. Time will be gone then. She\'85\
Mild fire of wine kindled his veins. I wanted that badly. Felt so off colour. His eyes unhungrily saw shelves of tins: sardines, gaudy lobsters\'92 claws. All the odd things people pick up for food. Out of shells, periwinkles with a pin, off trees, snails out of the ground the French eat, out of the sea with bait on a hook. Silly fish learn nothing in a thousand years. If you didn\'92t know risky putting anything into your mouth. Poisonous berries. Johnny Magories. Roundness you think good. Gaudy colour warns you off. One fellow told another and so on. Try it on the dog first. Led on by the smell or the look. Tempting fruit. Ice cones. Cream. Instinct. Orangegroves for instance. Need artificial irrigation. Bleibtreustrasse. Yes but what about oysters. Unsightly like a clot of phlegm. Filthy shells. Devil to open them too. Who found them out? Garbage, sewage they feed on. Fizz and Red bank oysters. Effect on the sexual. Aphrodis. He was in the Red Bank this morning. Was he oysters old fish at table perhaps he young flesh in bed no June has no ar no oysters. But there are people like things high. Tainted game. Jugged hare. First catch your hare. Chinese eating eggs fifty years old, blue and green again. Dinner of thirty courses. Each dish harmless might mix inside. Idea for a poison mystery. That archduke Leopold was it no yes or was it Otto one of those Habsburgs? Or who was it used to eat the scruff off his own head? Cheapest lunch in town. Of course aristocrats, then the others copy to be in the fashion. Milly too rock oil and flour. Raw pastry I like myself. Half the catch of oysters they throw back in the sea to keep up the price. Cheap no-one would buy. Caviare. Do the grand. Hock in green glasses. Swell blowout. Lady this. Powdered bosom pearls. The\'a0
\f1\i \'e9lite. Cr\'e8me de la cr\'e8me
\f0\i0 . They want special dishes to pretend they\'92re. Hermit with a platter of pulse keep down the stings of the flesh. Know me come eat with me. Royal sturgeon high sheriff, Coffey, the butcher, right to venisons of the forest from his ex. Send him back the half of a cow. Spread I saw down in the Master of the Rolls\'92 kitchen area. Whitehatted\'a0
\f1\i chef
\f0\i0 \'a0like a rabbi. Combustible duck. Curly cabbage\'a0
\f1\i \'e0 la duchesse de Parme
\f0\i0 . Just as well to write it on the bill of fare so you can know what you\'92ve eaten. Too many drugs spoil the broth. I know it myself. Dosing it with Edwards\'92 desiccated soup. Geese stuffed silly for them. Lobsters boiled alive. Do ptake some ptarmigan. Wouldn\'92t mind being a waiter in a swell hotel. Tips, evening dress, halfnaked ladies. May I tempt you to a little more filleted lemon sole, miss Dubedat? Yes, do bedad. And she did bedad. Huguenot name I expect that. A miss Dubedat lived in Killiney, I remember.\'a0
\f1\i Du, de la
\f0\i0 \'a0French. Still it\'92s the same fish perhaps old Micky Hanlon of Moore street ripped the guts out of making money hand over fist finger in fishes\'92 gills can\'92t write his name on a cheque think he was painting the landscape with his mouth twisted. Moooikill A Aitcha Ha ignorant as a kish of brogues, worth fifty thousand pounds.\
Stuck on the pane two flies buzzed, stuck.\
Glowing wine on his palate lingered swallowed. Crushing in the winepress grapes of Burgundy. Sun\'92s heat it is. Seems to a secret touch telling me memory. Touched his sense moistened remembered. Hidden under wild ferns on Howth below us bay sleeping: sky. No sound. The sky. The bay purple by the Lion\'92s head. Green by Drumleck. Yellowgreen towards Sutton. Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried cities. Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather scrub my hand under her nape, you\'92ll toss me all. O wonder! Coolsoft with ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not turn away. Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her mouth. Yum. Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and chewed. Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle. Joy: I ate it: joy. Young life, her lips that gave me pouting. Soft warm sticky gumjelly lips. Flowers her eyes were, take me, willing eyes. Pebbles fell. She lay still. A goat. No-one. High on Ben Howth rhododendrons a nannygoat walking surefooted, dropping currants. Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded. Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman\'92s breasts full in her blouse of nun\'92s veiling, fat nipples upright. Hot I tongued her. She kissed me. I was kissed. All yielding she tossed my hair. Kissed, she kissed me.\
Me. And me now.\
Stuck, the flies buzzed.\
His downcast eyes followed the silent veining of the oaken slab. Beauty: it curves: curves are beauty. Shapely goddesses, Venus, Juno: curves the world admires. Can see them library museum standing in the round hall, naked goddesses. Aids to digestion. They don\'92t care what man looks. All to see. Never speaking. I mean to say to fellows like Flynn. Suppose she did Pygmalion and Galatea what would she say first? Mortal! Put you in your proper place. Quaffing nectar at mess with gods golden dishes, all ambrosial. Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled mutton, carrots and turnips, bottle of Allsop. Nectar imagine it drinking electricity: gods\'92 food. Lovely forms of women sculped Junonian. Immortal lovely. And we stuffing food in one hole and out behind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like stoking an engine. They have no. Never looked. I\'92ll look today. Keeper won\'92t see. Bend down let something drop see if she.\
Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do there to do. A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.\
When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book:\
\'97What is this he is? Isn\'92t he in the insurance line?\
\'97He\'92s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. He does canvassing for the\'a0
\f1\i Freeman.
\f0\i0 \
\'97I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. Is he in trouble?\
\'97Trouble? Nosey Flynn said. Not that I heard of. Why?\
\'97I noticed he was in mourning.\
\'97Was he? Nosey Flynn said. So he was, faith. I asked him how was all at home. You\'92re right, by God. So he was.\
\'97I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a gentleman is in trouble that way. It only brings it up fresh in their minds.\
\'97It\'92s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said. I met him the day before yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan\'92s wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half. She\'92s well nourished, I tell you. Plovers on toast.\
\'97And is he doing for the\'a0
\f1\i Freeman?
\f0\i0 \'a0Davy Byrne said.\
Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.\
\'97-He doesn\'92t buy cream on the ads he picks up. You can make bacon of that.\
\'97How so? Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.\
Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers. He winked.\
\'97He\'92s in the craft, he said.\
\'97-Do you tell me so? Davy Byrne said.\
\'97Very much so, Nosey Flynn said. Ancient free and accepted order. He\'92s an excellent brother. Light, life and love, by God. They give him a leg up. I was told that by a\'97well, I won\'92t say who.\
\'97Is that a fact?\
\'97O, it\'92s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. They stick to you when you\'92re down. I know a fellow was trying to get into it. But they\'92re as close as damn it. By God they did right to keep the women out of it.\
Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one:\
\'97Iiiiiichaaaaaaach!\
\'97There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing. But be damned but they smelt her out and swore her in on the spot a master mason. That was one of the saint Legers of Doneraile.\
Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:\
\'97And is that a fact? Decent quiet man he is. I often saw him in here and I never once saw him\'97you know, over the line.\
\'97God Almighty couldn\'92t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly. Slips off when the fun gets too hot. Didn\'92t you see him look at his watch? Ah, you weren\'92t there. If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. Declare to God he does.\
\'97There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. He\'92s a safe man, I\'92d say.\
\'97He\'92s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up. He\'92s been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow. Give the devil his due. O, Bloom has his good points. But there\'92s one thing he\'92ll never do.\
His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.\
\'97I know, Davy Byrne said.\
\'97Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.\
Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in. Tom Rochford followed frowning, a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.\
\'97Day, Mr Byrne.\
\'97Day, gentlemen.\
They paused at the counter.\
\'97Who\'92s standing? Paddy Leonard asked.\
\'97I\'92m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.\
\'97Well, what\'92ll it be? Paddy Leonard asked.\
\'97I\'92ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.\
\'97How much? Paddy Leonard cried. Since when, for God\'92 sake? What\'92s yours, Tom?\
\'97How is the main drainage? Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.\
For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped.\
\'97Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? he said.\
\'97Certainly, sir.\
Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.\
\'97Lord love a duck, he said. Look at what I\'92m standing drinks to! Cold water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg. He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup. A dead snip.\
\'97Zinfandel is it? Nosey Flynn asked.\
Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him.\
\'97That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.\
\'97Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.\
Tom Rochford nodded and drank.\
\'97Is it Zinfandel?\
\'97Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked. I\'92m going to plunge five bob on my own.\
\'97Tell us if you\'92re worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard said. Who gave it to you?\
Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.\
\'97So long! Nosey Flynn said.\
The others turned.\
\'97That\'92s the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.\
\'97Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn. Mr Byrne, sir, we\'92ll take two of your small Jamesons after that and a\'85\
\'97Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.\
\'97Ay, Paddy Leonard said. A suckingbottle for the baby.\
Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth smooth. Something green it would have to be: spinach, say. Then with those Rontgen rays searchlight you could.\cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb2 At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the cobblestones and lapped it with new zest. Surfeit. Returned with thanks having fully digested the contents. First sweet then savoury. Mr Bloom coasted warily. Ruminants. His second course. Their upper jaw they move. Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his? Wasting time explaining it to Flynn\'92s mouth. Lean people long mouths. Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent free. Course then you\'92d have all the cranks pestering.\
He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars:\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa600\partightenfactor0

\f1\i \cf0 Don Giovanni, a cenar teco M\'92invitasti.
\f0\i0 \
Feel better. Burgundy. Good pick me up. Who distilled first? Some chap in the blues. Dutch courage. That\'a0

\f0\i0 \'a0in the national library now I must.\
Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber, turned back his thoughts. They could: and watch it all the way down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of intestines like pipes. But the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides entrails on show. Science.\
